# TailwindTemplates

A repo full of random web templates I've made using tailwind.

All templates are listed under the WTFPL - these templates are literally just for me to improve my web dev skills; I really do not care what you decide to do with them (but, let me know if you make something awesome, and we can add it below!)

## Ortho

Good-looking auth pages for any site (login, register, forgotten pass, SSO, 2FA)
